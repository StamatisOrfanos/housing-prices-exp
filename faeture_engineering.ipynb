    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "In this notebook, we apply feature engineering techniques to enhance the dataset and prepare it for modeling. The goal is to extract, transform, and encode features in a way that improves the modelâ€™s ability to predict `SalePrice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handle missing values**\n",
    "   - Domain-specific imputation strategies\n",
    "   - Use of indicators for missingness (if meaningful)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transform variables**\n",
    "   - Log transformation for skewed features\n",
    "   - Binning or discretization of continuous variables\n",
    "   - Date or time-based feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encode categorical features**\n",
    "   - Ordinal encoding for ranked categories\n",
    "   - One-hot encoding for nominal variables\n",
    "   - Group rare categories\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create new features**\n",
    "   - Total square footage (`TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`)\n",
    "   - Age-related features (`Age = YrSold - YearBuilt`)\n",
    "   - Quality-related scores (`OverallQual * OverallCond`)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature scaling (if required)**\n",
    "   - Standardization or normalization of numerical values for certain models\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome:**  \n",
    "We produce a cleaned and transformed dataset with meaningful features that are ready to be fed into machine learning models for accurate price prediction.\n"
